# PlanWise Design Matrix

An internal intelligence platform that transforms unstructured retirement plan documents into structured data for automated peer analysis, recommendation generation, and client deliverable creation for 850+ tax-exempt DC clients.

## Overview

The PlanWise Design Matrix is the data foundation and analytical engine for retirement plan consulting. It extracts plan design features from documents, maintains a queryable database of plan provisions, and generates peer benchmarking insights to drive advisory conversations.

**Key Value Proposition:** Enable data-driven retirement plan consulting at scale by automating plan data extraction, peer comparisons, and recommendation generation.
