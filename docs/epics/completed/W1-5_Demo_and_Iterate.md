# Epic W1-5: Demo & Iterate

**Epic ID:** W1-5
**Epic Name:** Demo & Iterate (Validate Value Proposition)
**Priority:** Critical - Week 1 Success Gate
**Estimated Effort:** 1 day
**Phase:** Week 1 - Prove the Concept
**Dependencies:** W1-1, W1-2, W1-3, W1-4 (All Week 1 epics completed)

---

## Epic Summary

Conduct structured demos with stakeholders (AEs, consultants, leadership) to validate the platform's value proposition, gather feedback, and document learnings that will inform Week 2+ priorities. Generate 5 high-value client decks as demo materials and proof of concept.

**Key Principle:** This is the validation gate—does the platform solve a real problem worth investing in?

## Business Value

- **Validation:** Confirm platform addresses actual user pain points
- **Buy-In:** Secure stakeholder support for continued development
- **Prioritization:** Identify which features deliver most value (inform roadmap)
- **Learning:** Document gaps, edge cases, and user requirements before scaling

## Objectives

1. Generate 5 polished peer comparison decks for high-value clients
2. Conduct 3-5 stakeholder demos with structured feedback collection
3. Document what resonated most with users
4. Identify Week 2+ priorities based on feedback
5. Create business case for continued investment

## Demo Client Selection

Select 5 clients that represent different scenarios:

1. **Typical 401(k) Plan** - Higher education, 2000-3000 participants, has match + auto-enrollment
2. **Large Plan** - Healthcare, 5000+ participants, comprehensive benefits
3. **Small Plan** - Manufacturing, 500-1000 participants, basic benefits
4. **403(b) Plan** - University, 1500 participants, different feature set
5. **Gap Plan** - Missing common features (no match or no auto-enrollment) to show recommendation power

## Demo Script (15 minutes)

### Part 1: The Problem (2 minutes)

**Script:**
> "Today, when an AE prepares for a client meeting, they spend 4-6 hours:
> - Manually extracting plan data from Form 5500s
> - Building Excel comparisons against 'similar' plans (based on memory, not data)
> - Creating PowerPoint slides from scratch
> - Writing recommendations based on intuition, not statistical analysis
>
> The result? Inconsistent quality, delayed analysis, and recommendations that lack rigor.
>
> **Question:** Does this match your experience?"

### Part 2: The Solution (5 minutes)

**Script:**
> "This week, we built a proof of concept with 20 real clients. Let me show you what's now possible..."

**[Live Demo]**
1. Open Streamlit dashboard
2. Select demo client from dropdown
3. Show plan details populate automatically
4. Highlight peer cohort selection (industry + size)
5. Show percentile comparisons and charts
6. Click "Generate PowerPoint" → show 30-second generation
7. Open generated deck, walk through 3 slides
8. Emphasize: "This deck took 30 seconds. Manually? 4 hours."

**Script:**
> "Notice what the platform does:
> - Peer selection is systematic, not ad-hoc
> - Percentile rankings are statistically rigorous
> - Charts are auto-generated with clean visuals
> - Recommendations reference peer data explicitly
>
> And this is Week 1 with 20 manually-entered clients."

### Part 3: The Results (3 minutes)

**Script:**
> "We've generated these 5 sample decks for high-value clients. Let me show you two examples..."

**[Show 2 Generated Decks]**
- Walk through first deck: typical plan, positive findings
- Walk through second deck: gap plan, actionable recommendations

**Script:**
> "Here's what changes with this platform:
> - **Time:** 6 hours → 1 hour (data entry) + 30 seconds (deck generation)
> - **Quality:** Consistent, data-driven vs. ad-hoc
> - **Scale:** Do this for 850 clients, not just 20
>
> **Question:** Would you use these decks in client meetings?"

### Part 4: What's Next (5 minutes)

**Script:**
> "This is Week 1. Here's what we're considering for Week 2+:
> - Expand to 50 clients (then 200, then 850)
> - Start automating extraction (Form 5500 fields)
> - Add more comparison metrics (vesting, loans, investments)
> - Build custom cohort filters
> - Add Navigator integration
>
> **Question:** What would make this most valuable to you?"

## Business Case Update

### Time Savings Calculation
```
Current State:
- 6 hours per client analysis (manual extraction + Excel + PowerPoint)
- 50 analyses per year across team
- 300 hours/year total

With Platform (Week 1 Capability):
- 1 hour per client (manual entry into platform)
- 30 seconds per PowerPoint generation
- 50 hours/year + 25 seconds = ~51 hours/year

Time Saved: 249 hours/year = $50K+ at $200/hour blended rate

With Platform (Future State - Automated Extraction):
- 15 minutes per client (review low-confidence fields)
- 30 seconds per PowerPoint generation
- 13 hours/year

Time Saved: 287 hours/year = $57K+ in capacity unlocked
```

### Revenue Impact
```
Opportunity Identification:
- Data-driven insights identify 20 consulting opportunities/year
- 40% conversion rate = 8 additional engagements
- $100K average engagement size
- $800K incremental revenue annually
```

### User Quotes (Collect During Demos)
> "This would have saved me 8 hours last week preparing for the XYZ meeting"
> "The peer selection is much more rigorous than how I do it manually"
> "I'd use this deck directly with my client—it's that polished"
