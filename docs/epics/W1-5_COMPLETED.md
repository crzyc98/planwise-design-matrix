## Known Limitations to Address in Demos

### Small Peer Cohorts
- Database has only 29 clients → peer cohorts are 2-5 plans
- Statistical significance requires 20+ (k-anonymity)
- **Mitigation:** Explain this is Week 1 POC, Week 2 expands to 50-100 clients

### Missing Metrics
- No vesting schedule comparisons yet
- No loan provision analysis
- No investment menu comparisons
- **Mitigation:** Prioritize based on feedback survey rankings

### Template Limitations
- Generic PowerPoint design (no custom branding)
- Basic 3-slide structure
- Charts as images (not editable objects)
- **Mitigation:** Position as POC; professional templates on work machine

### Data Quality
- Manual data entry = potential for errors
- No audit trail on data sources
- **Mitigation:** Emphasize automation in Week 2+ will improve accuracy

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- Systematic client selection process ensured diverse scenarios
- PowerPoint generator performed flawlessly (0 errors)
- Business case with 3-year projections provides clear decision framework
