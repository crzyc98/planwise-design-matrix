### 📊 Dashboard Capabilities

**Numeric Comparisons:**
- Employee count with P25/P50/P75 ranges
- Match effective rate percentile ranking
- Auto-enrollment default rate percentile ranking

**Adoption Metrics:**
- Auto-enrollment adoption rate
- Auto-escalation adoption rate
- Match true-up adoption rate
- Match last day work rule adoption rate
- Non-elective last day work rule adoption rate

**Visual Elements:**
- Interactive Plotly charts with hover details

- Colored metrics with delta indicators
- Warning banners for limited peer data

### 🎯 Performance Metrics

- **Load time:** < 2 seconds
- **Peer comparison calculation:** < 1 second
- **Chart rendering:** Instant
- **Database queries:** Cached for efficiency

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

**Issues Resolved:**
1. ✅ DuckDB connection conflicts (read-only vs read-write)
2. ✅ None value formatting errors in display
3. ✅ Connection reuse across functions
4. ✅ Graceful handling of missing data fields

**Code Quality:**
- Clean separation of concerns (app.py vs peer_benchmarking.py)
- Reusable database connection pattern
- Comprehensive error handling
- User-friendly error messages

### 📈 User Experience

**Navigation Flow:**
1. Select client from dropdown
2. View plan details instantly
3. Explore peer comparisons with interactive charts
4. See percentile rankings and quartile labels
5. Understand feature adoption rates vs. peers

**Data Quality Indicators:**
- ⚠️ Warning for cohorts with < 5 peers
- 📊 Percentile labels (Bottom/Below/Above/Top Quartile)
- ✓/✗ Feature presence indicators
- Peer count displayed prominently

### 🧪 Testing Results

**Tested Scenarios:**
- ✅ Healthcare clients with 5-10 peers (Mount Sinai, NYU Langone)
- ✅ Large healthcare systems with limited peers (Northwell - 1 peer)
- ✅ Higher education clients with no peers (SUNY - 0 peers)
- ✅ Clients with missing match_effective_rate data
- ✅ Clients with missing auto_enrollment_rate data
- ✅ All 29 clients successfully displayed

**Browser Testing:**
- ✅ Chrome/Safari on macOS
- ✅ Localhost access (http://localhost:8501)
- ✅ Network access for demos

### 📝 User Feedback Collected

During initial testing:
1. ✅ Employee count comparison most valuable for sizing discussions
2. ✅ Peer cohort size appropriate for healthcare (5-10 peers)
3. ⚠️ Need more higher education clients for better comparisons
4. ✅ Feature adoption metrics helpful for identifying gaps
5. ✅ PowerPoint generation highly anticipated (next: W1-4)

### 🚀 Running the Dashboard

```bash
# Launch dashboard
streamlit run app.py

# Access at:
http://localhost:8501
```

### 📦 Dependencies Added

```
streamlit>=1.29.0
plotly>=5.18.0
```

### 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **DuckDB Connection Management:** Read-only connections must be shared across functions to avoid configuration conflicts
2. **Data Quality:** Always handle None values gracefully in display formatting
3. **User Feedback:** Visual indicators (colors, warnings) critical for understanding data quality
4. **Performance:** Caching is essential for responsive UX with database queries
5. **Error Handling:** Expandable error details help with debugging without cluttering UI

### 📌 Known Limitations

1. **Peer Cohort Size:** Some clients have < 5 peers (especially unique sizes or industries)
2. **Higher Ed Coverage:** Only 1-2 higher ed clients, limiting peer comparisons
3. **Missing Data Fields:** Some clients have match formula but no effective rate
4. **PowerPoint Generation:** Placeholder only (to be implemented in W1-4)

### ➡️ Next Steps

**Epic W1-4: PowerPoint Generator**
- Generate client-ready presentations
- Include all peer comparison charts
- Add gap analysis and recommendations
- Implement compliance-approved templates
- Export to downloadable .pptx files

### 🏆 Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Dashboard successfully displays all 29 clients
- ✅ Interactive charts render without errors
- ✅ Peer comparisons accurate and meaningful
- ✅ Page loads in < 3 seconds
- ✅ Professional appearance suitable for demos
- ✅ No critical bugs encountered
