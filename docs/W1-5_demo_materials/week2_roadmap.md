## Example Roadmap Structure

### Option A: Expand Client Base (29 → 50 clients)

**Rationale:** Improve peer cohort quality before adding complexity
**Feedback Support:** [X]% of users ranked this as top priority

**Week 2 Activities:**
1. **Days 8-9: Data Collection**
   - Identify 21 additional clients (target industries: healthcare, higher ed)
   - Source documents: Form 5500, SPDs, plan documents
   - Create data entry queue

2. **Days 10-12: Manual Data Entry**
   - Enter 21 new clients into database
   - QA check for accuracy (spot check 20% of entries)
   - Verify peer cohort sizes improve (target: ≥5 peers per client)

3. **Days 13-14: Validation & Testing**
   - Regenerate all demo decks with expanded cohorts
   - Compare peer statistics (before/after expansion)
   - Document improvements in peer cohort quality
   - Generate 3 new demo decks for clients with previously insufficient peers

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 50 total clients in database
- [ ] Average peer cohort size ≥ 8 (up from ~3)
- [ ] No client with <3 peers in their cohort
- [ ] All 5 demo decks regenerated with improved statistics

**Risks:**
- **Data quality:** Manual entry introduces errors
  - Mitigation: Implement QA spot checks, double-entry for critical fields
- **Time overrun:** 21 clients may take longer than 3 days
  - Mitigation: Prioritize top 15 if behind schedule

---

### Option B: Automate Form 5500 Extraction (Phase 1)

**Rationale:** Reduce manual entry burden for scaling
**Feedback Support:** [X]% of users ranked this as top priority

**Week 2 Activities:**
1. **Days 8-9: Prototype Development**
   - Research OCR libraries (PyMuPDF, pytesseract)
   - Build proof of concept: extract 5 basic fields from Form 5500
     - Plan name
     - EIN (Employer Identification Number)
     - Participant count
     - Plan type (401k, 403b)
     - Administrator name
   - Test on 10 sample Form 5500s

2. **Days 10-12: Extraction Logic & Validation**
   - Implement field extraction for 5 basic fields
   - Build confidence scoring (high/medium/low confidence)
   - Create review queue for low-confidence extractions
   - Test accuracy on 20 additional Form 5500s
   - Target accuracy: ≥85% on basic fields

3. **Days 13-14: Integration & User Testing**
   - Integrate extraction into data entry workflow
   - Build simple UI for reviewing low-confidence fields
   - Test with 5-10 real clients
   - Document accuracy metrics and failure modes

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 5 basic fields extracted automatically from Form 5500
- [ ] Accuracy ≥85% on test set (n=30 Form 5500s)
- [ ] Confidence scoring implemented (flags <80% confidence for review)
- [ ] Extraction time ≤30 seconds per Form 5500
- [ ] 10 clients added to database using automated extraction

**Risks:**
- **Accuracy lower than expected:** OCR may struggle with poor-quality scans
  - Mitigation: Start with high-quality Form 5500s, flag low-quality for manual review
- **Complex extraction logic:** Form 5500 has inconsistent formats
  - Mitigation: Build rules for common formats, flag exceptions for manual review

---

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Expand + Improve)

**Rationale:** Balance scale (more clients) with quality (better features)
**Feedback Support:** No single dominant priority, balance multiple requests

**Week 2 Activities:**
1. **Days 8-10: Client Expansion (15 new clients)**
   - Add 15 clients manually (target: 44 total)
   - Prioritize industries with currently small cohorts
   - Focus on high-value clients (large employers, consulting opportunities)

2. **Days 11-12: PowerPoint Template Improvements**
   - Add executive summary slide
   - Improve chart aesthetics (based on feedback)
   - Add methodology explanation slide
   - Add custom disclaimer text
   - Regenerate demo decks with improved template

3. **Days 13-14: Additional Metrics (Tier 1)**
   - Add 2-3 new comparison metrics based on feedback:
     - Option 1: Vesting schedule comparison
     - Option 2: Participation rate benchmarking
     - Option 3: Contribution rate distributions
   - Implement in peer benchmarking logic
   - Update PowerPoint generator to include new metrics

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 44 total clients in database (15 new)
- [ ] PowerPoint template updated with 3 new slides/improvements
- [ ] 2-3 new metrics added to peer comparison
- [ ] All demo decks regenerated with improvements
- [ ] User feedback collected on improvements (quick survey to 3-5 users)

**Risks:**
- **Scope creep:** Trying to do too much in Week 2
  - Mitigation: Strict prioritization, cut secondary features if behind schedule
- **Diluted impact:** Not enough progress on any single dimension
  - Mitigation: Ensure each area shows measurable improvement
