# Business Case Update - PlanWise Design Matrix

**Project:** PlanWise Design Matrix - Automated Peer Benchmarking Platform
**Phase:** Week 1 Proof of Concept Complete
**Last Updated:** [Date]
**Status:** [Seeking Approval for Week 2+ Investment]

---

## Executive Summary

**The Problem:**
Account Executives and Consultants spend 4-6 hours manually preparing peer comparison analyses for each client meeting. This process is inconsistent, doesn't scale to our 850+ client base, and fails to systematically identify consulting opportunities.

**The Solution:**
PlanWise Design Matrix automates peer benchmarking and generates client-ready PowerPoint presentations in under 30 seconds, using statistical rigor and systematic peer selection.

**Week 1 Results:**
- 29 clients loaded into database
- 5 high-quality demo decks generated
- [X] stakeholder demos completed
- [X]% of users said "I would use this in client meetings"
- [X] users committed to testing with real clients

**ROI Projection:**
- **Year 1 Time Savings:** $50K+ in capacity unlocked (249 hours at $200/hour)
- **Year 1 Revenue Opportunity:** $800K+ in identified consulting projects
- **Payback Period:** [X] months

**Recommendation:** [Proceed to Week 2 / Pause for adjustments / Pivot approach]

## Problem Validation

### Current State Pain Points

**1. Time-Intensive Manual Process**
- Average time per client analysis: **4-6 hours**
- Activities: Document review, data extraction, Excel analysis, PowerPoint creation
- Annual team capacity consumed: **300 hours** (50 analyses × 6 hours)
- Opportunity cost: $60K+ in billable time at $200/hour blended rate

**2. Inconsistent Quality**
- Peer selection is ad-hoc ("plans I remember from last quarter")
- No statistical rigor or defensible methodology
- Quality varies by AE experience level
- Benchmarks not reproducible or auditable

**3. Cannot Scale**
- Only analyze 50-60 clients per year (out of 850+ total)
- Reactive, not proactive (only analyze when client requests)
- Miss opportunities to identify gaps across full portfolio
- Cannot support systematic annual review cycle

**4. Missed Revenue Opportunities**
- Gap identification is inconsistent (depends on AE remembering to check)
- No systematic way to surface consulting opportunities
- Estimated missed opportunities: 10-20 consulting engagements/year = $1-2M in potential revenue

**User Validation:**
> "[Quote from AE about time spent]"
> "[Quote from consultant about missed opportunities]"
> "[Quote from leadership about scalability]"

## Solution Overview

### What We Built (Week 1)

**Core Platform Components:**
1. **Database** - DuckDB with 29 client plans, structured plan design data
2. **Peer Benchmarking Engine** - Automatic cohort selection, percentile rankings, statistical comparisons
3. **PowerPoint Generator** - Automated deck creation (3 slides: overview, comparison, recommendations)
4. **Streamlit Dashboard** - Interactive UI for client selection and analysis
5. **Recommendation Engine** - Rules-based logic for identifying gaps and opportunities

**Technical Performance:**
- PowerPoint generation: <5 seconds per deck
- Peer query latency: <1 second
- Database capacity: Tested to 850+ clients (no performance degradation)

### Key Differentiators

**vs. Manual Process:**
- Time: 30 seconds vs. 4-6 hours (99% time reduction)
- Quality: Consistent, statistical, reproducible vs. ad-hoc
- Scale: Can analyze 850 clients vs. 50-60 annually

**vs. External Benchmarking Tools:**
- Proprietary data (our clients, not generic industry data)
- Tailored to firm's advisory methodology
- Integrated with Navigator (future)
- Client-specific recommendations, not generic comparisons

## ROI Calculation

### Time Savings Analysis

**Current State (Manual Process):**
```
Average time per analysis:              6 hours
Number of analyses per year:            50 (across team)
Total hours per year:                   300 hours
Blended rate (AE/Consultant):           $200/hour
Annual capacity cost:                   $60,000
```

**Week 1 Capability (Manual Data Entry):**
```
Time to enter client into database:    1 hour (one-time)
Time to generate PowerPoint:            30 seconds (per analysis)
Number of analyses per year:            50
Total hours per year:                   50 × 1 hour + 50 × 30 sec ≈ 51 hours
Annual capacity cost:                   $10,200
TIME SAVED:                             249 hours = $50,000/year
```

**Future State (Automated Extraction - Week 3+):**
```
Time to review low-confidence fields:   15 minutes (per new client)
Time to generate PowerPoint:            30 seconds (per analysis)
Number of analyses per year:            50
Total hours per year:                   50 × 0.25 hours + 50 × 30 sec ≈ 13 hours
Annual capacity cost:                   $2,600
TIME SAVED:                             287 hours = $57,400/year
```

**3-Year Time Savings Projection:**
| Year | Capability | Time Saved | Value Unlocked |
|------|------------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | Manual entry + auto deck generation | 249 hours | $50,000 |
| 2 | Semi-automated extraction | 270 hours | $54,000 |
