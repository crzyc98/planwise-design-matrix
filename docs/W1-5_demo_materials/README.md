## Known Issues & Limitations

### Week 1 Limitations
1. **Small peer cohorts:** Most clients have <5 peers due to 29-client database size
   - Mitigation: Expand to 50-100 clients in Week 2

2. **Manual data entry:** All 29 clients entered manually (time-intensive)
   - Mitigation: Automate Form 5500 extraction in Week 2+

3. **Basic metrics:** Currently only employee count, match, auto-enrollment
   - Mitigation: Add vesting, loans, investments in Week 2+

4. **Generic PowerPoint template:** No custom branding or advanced charts
   - Mitigation: Improve template based on feedback

### Issues Encountered During Generation
- **Caltech deck failed:** Client had 0 peers (too small, too unique)
  - Replaced with Mount Sinai Health (better peer cohort, better demo value)
