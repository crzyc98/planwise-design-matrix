# UI Prototype Prompts: Berkshire Health Systems Slides

**Purpose:** Recreate the three Berkshire Health Systems PowerPoint slides as interactive dashboard views.

---

## Prompt 1: Peer Benchmarking Assessment Table (Image 1)

```
Create an interactive HTML prototype of a peer benchmarking assessment table for retirement plans, based on a real PowerPoint slide design.

VISUAL DESIGN:
- Professional table with alternating row colors (light gray, white)
- Three columns: "Lever" | "Current Design & Assessment" | "Peer Average"
- Traffic light indicators: ‚ñ≤ (green triangle) | ‚óè (orange circle) | ‚ñº (red triangle)
- Header: "Berkshire Health Systems" title with "Peer Benchmarking & Assessment to Peers" subtitle

TABLE ROWS (5 features):

1. ELIGIBILITY
   Current: "1 year of service" [‚ñ≤ GREEN]
   Peers: "Majority have 1,000 hours or 1-year of service requirement."
   Assessment: "At peer average and recommended design for Healthcare plans."

2. AUTO-ENROLLMENT
   Current: "Yes, default 4%" [‚ñ≤ GREEN]
   Peers: "Majority offer, 3% median default (2-3% range)."
   Assessment: "Default 4% tops all peers and best practice."

3. AUTO-ESCALATION
   Current: "1%/yr up to 10%" [‚ñ≤ GREEN]
   Peers: "Minority of peers using; typical +1%/yr to 4-10% cap"
   Assessment: "Best practice design, exceeds peer set."

4. EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION
   Current: "50% up to 4% match, 2.5% NEC" [‚óè ORANGE]
   Peers: "5% median maximum (Discretionary to 7.5% range)."
   Assessment: "Competitive with peer set."

5. VESTING
   Current: "Immediate" [‚ñº RED]
   Peers: "Most common is 3-year cliff vesting"
   Assessment: "More generous than peers, helps recruiting but does not contribute to retention and allows for plan leakage."

FOOTER LEGEND:
- Red down triangle: "below peers"
- Orange circle: "at peer median"
- Green up triangle: "above peers and/or best practice"

STYLING:
- Clean, corporate design (grays, subtle borders)
- Traffic light colors: Green #10B981, Orange #F59E0B, Red #EF4444
- Font: Professional sans-serif (Inter or Arial)
- Header background: light gray
- Assessment text in "Peer Average" column: bold "Peers:" and "Œî vs Peers:" labels

INTERACTIVITY:
- Hover on row: highlight background
- Click traffic light icon: show tooltip with percentile details
- Click feature name: expand to show more detail
- Print-friendly layout

Make it look exactly like the PowerPoint slide but interactive and responsive.

   Recruitment: -
   Retention: ‚ñ≤
   Cost/ROI: -
   Retirement: -
   Efficiency: ‚ñ≤

2. AUTO-ENROLLMENT
   Current: "Yes, default 4%"
   Recruitment: ‚ñ≤
   Retention: ‚ñ≤
   Cost/ROI: -
   Retirement: ‚ñ≤‚ñ≤
   Efficiency: ‚ñ≤

3. AUTO-ESCALATION
   Current: "1%/yr up to 10%"
   Recruitment: ‚ñ≤
   Retention: ‚ñ≤
   Cost/ROI: -

   Retention: ‚ñ≤
   Cost/ROI: -
   Retirement: ‚ñ≤
   Efficiency: ‚ñ≤

5. VESTING
   Current: "Immediate"

- ‚ñ≤ = Positive impact (1 green triangle)
- ‚ñº = Negative impact (1 red triangle)
- - = No material impact (dash)

RECOMMENDATIONS SECTION (bottom):
"PlanWise Navigator Considerations (Impact / Cost / Complexity)"
‚Ä¢ Now: Consider 3-year cliff vesting to promote retention and limit plan leakage. (‚Üë‚Üë, $ Savings, Low)
‚Ä¢ Next: Review competitive peer set to consider contribute design for potential improvements. (‚Üë‚Üë, $$-$$$, Low)

STYLING:
- Professional corporate design
- Icons: emoji or colored triangles
- Alternating row backgrounds (light gray #F3F4F6, white)

## React Component Structure

Once you've prototyped in Claude Artifacts, here's how they map to React components:

```typescript
// Tab 1: Overview
<PeerBenchmarkTable>
  <TableHeader />
  <TableRow feature="Eligibility" status="above" />
  <TableRow feature="Auto-Enrollment" status="above" />
  <TableRow feature="Match" status="median" />
  <TableRow feature="Vesting" status="below" />
  <TableLegend />
</PeerBenchmarkTable>

// Tab 2: Scorecard
<NavigatorScorecard>
  <ScorecardSummary />
  <ImpactMatrix features={features} dimensions={dimensions} />
  <RecommendationsPanel recommendations={recs} />
</NavigatorScorecard>

// Tab 3: Distributions
<DistributionCharts>
  <HistogramChart
    data={employerContribution}
    yourValue={4.5}
    peerAvg={4.8}
    nationalAvg={5.8}
  />
  <ChartFilters />
  <AdditionalCharts />
</DistributionCharts>
```

## Next Steps

1. **Copy Prompt 1** ‚Üí Paste into Claude.ai ‚Üí Get interactive HTML prototype
2. **Review & Iterate:** "Make the table wider", "Add more hover effects"
3. **Repeat for Prompts 2 & 3**
4. **Test Combined View:** Use the "Combined Prompt" for full dashboard
5. **Share with Team:** Download HTML files and get feedback
6. **Build in React:** Port approved designs to Vite components

**These slides are production-quality designs.** They should absolutely become the template for your dashboard UI. The traffic light system (‚ñ≤‚óè‚ñº) is perfect for quick visual scanning, and the multi-dimensional scorecard is exactly what consultants need.

Let me know when you're ready to prototype these - I can help refine the prompts further!
